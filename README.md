# Stock_Price_Analysis

In stock market the stock prices of companies are volatile to the market condition, so to understand the vulnerability of the stock we have used python to perform exploratory data analysis.
in this we have taken data of five years from yahoo finance to research the prices are when market open (represented as open), during high & low (represented as high, low), when market close (represented as close) and the total quantity of stocks traded on that day (represented as volume) for 3 companies that is TCS, INFOSYS & WIPRO.

we have used libraries like yahoo finance ,pandas , numpy , matplotliob. By using matplotlib we are analysing the stock prices at open and then the volume of stocks that were traded.we have calculated moving average to make price data easy to diget format. we applied scater plot matrix to visualize bivariate relationship between variables. we have paid attention to the percentage increase in stock value which means if you got bigger value whether it is positive or negative it shows the volatality of the stock. we got clear picture of whose stock price is showing increase .

we have understood both short and long term fluctuations in stocks so a support system can be created possibly to help investor in a way to invest in stocks depending on their risk taking capacity.
